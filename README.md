# Computer Science and Programming - Continuous Study
As a Software Development Engineer without a CS degree, I can keep up with my colleagues and contribute to my team through my own version of CS- continuous study :-)

This repo will keep track of my efforts to improve my skills and cultivate my knowledge of computer science fundamentals, web development, and language-specific skills. It's largely based off of the excellent guides from [p 1xt](https://github.com/p1xt-guides/blob/master/README.md) as well as other resources I've gathered from Reddit, Medium, and Udemy.
