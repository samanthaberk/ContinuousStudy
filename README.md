# Computer Science and Programming - Continuous Study
As a Software Development Engineer without a CS degree, I can keep up with my colleagues and contribute to my team through my own version of CS- continuous study :-) 

This repo will keep track of my efforts to improve my skills and cultivate my knowledge of computer science fundamentals, web development, and language-specific skills. It's largely based off of the excellent guides from [p 1xt](https://github.com/p1xt-guides/blob/master/README.md) as well as other resources I've gathered from Reddit, Medium, and Udemy.

| Complete a [Specialization](#specializations) - note: you will have the opportunity to complete a specialization in each tier so don't worry overmuch about picking 'the right one'. That said, for your first specialization [Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - App Academy Open](./specializations/app_academy_open.md) is highly recommended. |            |

### Tier 5 - Specialize

Wrap up by diving more deeply into your specialization(s). If you haven't already done an [Advanced Specialization](#advanced-specializations), strongly consider including it in this tier. Beyond that, feel free to laser focus on one specialization, practicing more in that area, or branch out and develop expertise across multiple specializations.
